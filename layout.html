<h3>Schematic overview of <i>DycomDetector</i></h3>
	<i>DycomDetector</i> is a novel approach for topic modeling in text corpora. Our algorithm extracts and classifies the keywords, calculates relationships based on keywork co-ocurrences, constructs the networks at different time points, applies a graph partitioning algorithm to extract latent communities. The intuitive interface of our system supports various interactive features, such as lensing and filerting by <i>sudden increase</i> in term ferequency, <i>vertex degree</i>, <i>betweenness centrality</i>, etc. It also allows the users to search for a topic of interest and visualize its temporal relations with other detected communities.

To enable users to explore the vast temporal text corpora in an efficient way, <i>DycomDetector</i> adopts following steps (as depicted in the above figure):
<ol>
  <li><b>Extract and classify terms:</b> The text documents are preprocessed into entities, ranked by frequencies, and further classified into different categories: <span style="color:#2077b5">people</span>, <span style="color:#ff7f0f">places</span>, <span style="color:#2c9f2e">organizations</span>, and <span style="color:#d52829">miscellaneous</span>.
</li>
  <li><b>Construct networks of collocated terms:</b> This step constructs the relations of terms/phrases based on their co-occurences in the same political blogs. At each time point, we obtain a network snapshot of important terms.</li>
  <li><b>Refine the network snapshots:</b> In the above example, we filter vertices with frequency more than <b>6</b>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity">Louvain method</a> is applied on the refined networks automatically to detect political events (detected communities highlighted in gray background in the last panel).</li>
  <li><b>Generate visualization and interactions:</b> Each sub-network (at each time point) is represented as a thumbnail which summarizes its network structure. Modularity histograms, text clouds, arcs diagrams, and small multiples provide supplementary views of these sub-networks.</li>
</ol> 
Here are some important political events (term communities) detected in the above example:
<ul>
  <li><b>Box A:</b> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting</a> occurred on December 14, 2012, in <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Newtown</span>, <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Connecticut</span>, when 20-year-old <span style="color:#2077b5">Adam Lanza</span> fatally shot 20 children.</li>
</ul>
